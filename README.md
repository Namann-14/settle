# settle

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@settle/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment

### Vercel Services

- Target: web
- Config: `vercel.json`
- Link the project first: npm run deploy:setup
- Local Vercel dev: npm run dev:vercel
- Sync preview env: npm run env:preview
- Sync production env: npm run env:production
- Dry-run check (no upload): npm run deploy:check
- Preview deploy: npm run deploy
- Production deploy: npm run deploy:prod
  Vercel Services share project environment variables, but deploys do not upload local `.env` files automatically. Link the project with `vercel link`, then run the env sync command before your first deploy (otherwise the deployment starts with no env vars), or pass one-off envs with `vercel deploy -e KEY=value`.
  Pass Vercel CLI flags to the env sync command directly, for example: `npm run env:production --scope your-team`.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying to Vercel](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/vercel).
